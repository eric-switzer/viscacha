`Viscacha`
==========
`viscacha` is a command/monitor GUI through `Redis` (`http://redis.io`).

Installing on a mac:
--------------------

1. `sudo port install py27-redis` or `git clone https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py.git`
2. `sudo port install py27-wxpython` or install the .dmg from the wxpython site
3. `sudo port install py27-simplejson`
4. the wxpython binaries from the .dmg installation are 32bit, so use `arch -i386 python2.7 client.py`
(Please update as needed.)

Installing on Ubuntu:
---------------------

1. get git `sudo apt-get install git-core`
2. `git clone https://github.com/eric-switzer/viscacha.git`
3. `sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8`
4. Depending on your version of Ubuntu, (new Ubuntu) `sudo apt-get install python-redis`, `git clone https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py.git` and `cd redis-py; sudo python setup.py install`; you may need to remove an old package version using `sudo apt-get remove python-redis` if it interferes.

Please contact me with updates or different systems.

The interface:
--------------

The GUI is built from a JSON specification that can be retrieved online or as a local file. The redis ports should stay behind a firewall in a local network. To tunnel through a gateway, issue:
`ssh  -l username -L 6379:redis_servername:6379  gateway_name  cat -`

Getting started: `device-client.py` is a client for a mock device to be controlled. Start a copy of that and also an instance of `redis-cli` running `monitor` to see the exchange. Next start the client, `python client.py`.

When `client.py` starts, it opens a window titled `Command Window`. This has buttons `Refresh` (get current values from redis for each variable), `Who` (see what clients are registered) and `Send comment` (publish a comment that all clients can see and log). Under `Monitor` and `Command`, select systems to either passively monitor or send commands to.

When a control system window comes up, it will have sub-system tabs, and within those, a list of variables. Each variable has a description, a current value indicator, and a method of sending a new value. When the value gets sent, the indicator box becomes yellow until it hears an acknowledgement from the device client that the command has been received and acted on. If the acknowledgement returns the requested value (success), the box turns green and if not, it turns red.

The GUI never sets Redis keys, and the device client is responsible for keeping its variables synchronized with Redis. The client device may access or set some internal variables at a rate too high for Redis. An example here could be a group of high-rate servo loops. In this case, the device client keeps an internal dictionary of variables rather than accessing Redis. In open loop, these can be reported/set on Redis, and in closed loop a value indicating that could be set on Redis rather than the live actuator value.

Configuration:
--------------

The configuration is managed in a JSON file.

* `system`: everything in the same system get lumped into a window
* `category`: everything within the same category in that system gets lumped into a tab in the system window
* `displayorder`: order of how the variable/action buttons appear in the tab (linear)
* `destination`: name to publish `redis` command to
* `type`: The `type` field indicates the kind of entry for the variable/action. Allowed values are `input_onoff`, `input_value`, and `input_select`. The on/off type gives a toggle switch that switches between 0 and 1. The value type allows the user to set a variable to a numerical value. The "select" type does not send a value be instead triggers some action on the device.
* `confirm`: an optional keyword that requires user confirmation before sending a command
* `minmax`: an optional keyword for `input_value` that specifies the allowed range of the value (interpreted as a float)
